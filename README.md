## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned how to align list items in Tailwind and how to adjust the spacing, making sure the indentations looks right by enclosing the list items in a `<div>` first.

```
<li><div class="pl-4">2-3 large eggs</div></li>
<li><div class="pl-4">Salt, to taste</div></li>
<li><div class="pl-4">Pepper, to taste</div></li>
<li><div class="pl-4">1 tablespoon of butter or oil</div></li>
```
